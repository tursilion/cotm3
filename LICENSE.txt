(c)1995 by M. Brent. This program is freeware, but not public domain. It may
be distributed and used on any BBS system or personal computer, so long as
it is not modified and is freely accessible. If any pay-for-access BBS wants
to use it, I ask that they contact me first, perhaps with a demo account of
their system so I can take a look. The only compensation I ask for this
program being run on a free BBS is that you send me the BBS number!
